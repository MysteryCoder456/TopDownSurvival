# Top Down Survival
As the name suggests, this is a Top Down Survival game. It's a multiplayer game
so you need friends to play. Art work inspired by [Zombs.io](https://zombs.io)

This game also uses [Godotcord](https://github.com/Drachenfrucht1/godotcord) to integrate Discord GameSDK, so make sure you install that if you decide to build and run this game from source.

## How to run the game?
The game is made with Godot Engine, so you need to install that to play it
(or you can just download the prebuilt binaries in the releases section).

**NOTE:** Please do not use local IP addresses to connect to a server (usually
starting with `192.168`). However, if you're hosting the client and server on
the same machine, connecting to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) will work.
