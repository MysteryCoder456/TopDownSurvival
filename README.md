# Top Down Survival

As the name suggests, this is a top down survival game. It's a multiplayer game
made with the Godot Engine. Art work inspired by [Zombs.io](https://zombs.io)

## How to run the game?

The game's client uses [Godotcord](https://github.com/Drachenfrucht1/godotcord)
to integrate Discord's GameSDK, so make sure to install it if you're going to
make modifications or export the game on your own. There are pre-built export
templates in `Top Down Survival/bin` which you can access after running
`git lfs pull`.

If you're just here to play the game and nothing else, you can download the
pre-built binaries from the Releases tab or from the
[itch.io page](https://mysterycoder456.itch.io/top-down-survival).

**NOTE:** Please do not use local IP addresses to connect to a server (usually
starting with `192.168`). However, if you're hosting the client and server on
the same machine, connecting to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) will work.
